# PcrScoring
This is the source code for our paper [pCR-Score](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12967-021-03020-z.pdf).

CNN-I contains the code for training and testing the TE identifying model.

CNN-II contains the code for training and testing the model for generating the pCR-score marker.
Training CNN-II: first run training_scl.py, then based on the trained model to run training_pcr-scoring.py
